# Download CNEFE datasets from Brazilian Census (IBGE)
Repository created to help access data from CNEFE, the National Register of Addresses for Statistical Purposes (Cadastro Nacional de Estabelecimentos para Fins Estatísticos) of the 2010 Census, developed by IBGE - Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística). Data provided by IBGE consists of a countrywide georeferenced register of addresses, which classifies addresses by type (residential, non-residential, etc.).

[More Info from the official website](https://www.ibge.gov.br/estatisticas/sociais/trabalho/9662-censo-demografico-2010.html) or [Here](https://censo2010.ibge.gov.br/cnefe/)

Although it is possible to access and download the CNEFE files directly from IBGE's server (here), the large volume of files makes it impractical to deal with this database. This repository presents auxiliary functions that allow you to easily download the IBGE data and process them in a fast way, generating a manipulable database with few lines of code.
